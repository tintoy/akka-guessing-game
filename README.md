# Akka guess-the-number game

A simple guess-the-number game using Akka to model the game state. For now, this is mainly a way to learn about modelling actor behaviour, but eventually the game itself will be exposed as a web API for commands (using Akka HTTP) and bridged SignalR hub for game-state notifications.
